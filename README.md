# Radial Basis Function Neural Network

A Radial Basis Function is implemented using a Feedforward Neural Network and backpropagation to perform classification and regression on several datasets. Tuning of algorithm hyper-parameters is necessary to achieve good results. 

The datasets used are publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php. This was part of a machine learning project for Montana State University in Fall 2019. This was part of a group project, and included here is only the algorithm written by Cassie Noble, as well as any other code needed for the analysis.
